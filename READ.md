# Real-time System Monitoring
  There are large slots dedicated to laboratories for programming and application development in our curriculum. But they prove to be less productive than they actually should be. This is due to the ignorant nature of the students and also the lack of monitoring. The teachers cannot just continuously monitor each and every student’s desktop. The driving factor behind this proposed application is to make this monitoring easy and effective. There is a desktop application running on the teacher’s desktop. The application itself monitors the PC’s which are connected to the local network. Now, the teacher can select among the various options available and then click on Get Shot. The snapshot of the student’s screen is sent to the teacher’s desktop using socket programming.
